\chapter{Conclusions}

- Just a suggestion of where the differences are, still needs human help.



\section{Future works}

- Improve Tensor-based method.

- Figure out which values of the Jacobian are actually useful or use the Jacobian matrix.

- Both growth and shrinkage show always, sometimes unexpected, better differenciation? or just treat them as one?

- Green is not sensitive enough, pink is VERY sensitive. Make if better somehow?

- Make it public to Slicer people.
