- Just a suggestion of where the differences are, still needs human help.



\section{Future works}

The tensor-based method needs to be improved in order to obtain more
exact results, and for it to be able to detect smaller differences.

The first thing that should be done is either find a better way of
figuring out which range of values of the \textit{Jacobian
  determinant} are actually useful to detect differences, or directly
using the \textit{Jacobian matrix} to calculate the changes in volume
between the MRIs.

Manipulating the \textit{Jacobian matrix} is harder than using the
\textit{Jacobian determinant} since, according to my research, there
is no \textit{ITK} function or library already implemented to use
it. Some theoretical pointers on how to use the matrix can be found in
\cite{ashburner}.\\

The voxel-based method seems to work quite well in our experiments
with both real and artificial differences between volumes. However, it
would be very interesting to be able to compare its results against
another tool with the same goals.\\

We would like the modules to be available for all the users of
\textit{3D Slicer} and for the public in general. To achieve this
goal, a few specific conditions must be fulfilled in order for the
module to be accepted as part of the \textit{3D Slicer} code.

This would probably produce some criticism from the \textit{3D Slicer}
developer community, which could contain useful comments on the
current implementation of the modules and how to improve it.\\
