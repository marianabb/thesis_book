\section{Morphometry}
Morphometry refers to the measurement of external form. More specifically, \textit{brain morphometry} is concerned with the measurement of brain structures and changes thereof during development, aging, learning, disease and evolution. Its goal is to derive specific information from noninvasive neuroimaging data of live brains, tipically obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and to quantify the anatomical features of the brain in terms of shape, mass and volume. \cite{brmorph}
