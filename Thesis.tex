	\begin{abstract}
      The focus of this research is to attempt to solve the problem of
      comparing two MRI brain volumes of the same subject taken at
      different times, and detect the location and size of the
      differences between them, especially when such differences are
      too small to be perceived with the naked eye.

      The research focuses on a combination of registration and
      morphometry techniques already existent, in order to create two
      different possible solutions: A voxel-based method and a
      tensor-based method. The first method uses \textit{Affine} or
      \textit{BSpline} registration combined with voxel-by-voxel
      subtraction of the volumes; the second method uses
      \textit{Demons} registration and analysis of the
      \textit{Jacobian determinants} at each point of the deformation
      field, obtained as a result from the registration. The methods
      are implemented as modules for \textit{3D Slicer}, an already
      existent software for medical image analysis and visualization.

      Both methods are tested on two types of experiments:
      Artificial experiments, in which made-up differences of
      distinct sizes are added to volumes of healthy subjects; and
      real experiments, in which MRIs of actual patients of the
      Uppsala University Hospital are compared.

      The results obtained from the voxel-based method are very
      useful, since it was able to detect with almost complete
      accuracy all of the artificial differences and expected real
      differences during the experiments.

      The tensor-based method's results are not as accurate in
      location or size of the detected differences, and it usually
      includes more areas of differences where there seems to be none;
      even though it behaves adequately when the differences are
      large.

      From this research, it can be concluded that most of the results
      obtained are useful for the diagnostic of real patients with
      non-severe trauma to the head; especially when using the
      voxel-based method. However, the results from both methods are
      just a suggestion of the size and location of injuries; and as a
      consequence, the procedure requires the presence of a medical
      practitioner.
      
      It is recommended to continue the development of the
      tensor-based method by using the \textit{Jacobian matrix}
      instead or together with the \textit{Jacobian determinants}.
